# Want-In

An app to help event and workshop organizers create an intuitive and easy-to-mantain platform for their registrations.
Being an organizer myself, I've always found it a bit frustrating to be going through different platforms to keep track of everything realted ot my workshops and events. So I started developing _Want-In_ as a easy-to-manage registration and event coordination platform.

There are still a lot of features to be implemented and a lot of work to do in terms of the UI, but this is a project that will be developed with time and taking any help and resources from people interested in contribute.
